Your responsibility is to select and analyze relevant data, interpret your findings, and recommend a strategy. Multiple teams are working on different aspects of this issue, and your group has been assigned to focus on monarch butterflies.
Your report must address the following:
 A detailed description of monarch butterfly population fluctuations.
 An investigation of factors that may be contributing to these population
changes, and the potential consequences for human well-being.
 A recommendation for resource allocation, prioritizing the most significant
factors identified in your analysis.
 A focused analysis of the monarch butterfly migration through Texas, with
comparisons to other states.
Your team will deliver an executive report supported by an appendix containing
technical details.
